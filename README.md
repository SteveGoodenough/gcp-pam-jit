## Introduction

This project is CLI that allows for the employees to request Just-in-time access to GCP resources for a limited time using the
[Google Privileged Access Manager](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-overview).

It's composed of two main components:

* A CLI that allows the user to request access to a GCP project
* TODO: A Slack integration that allows the designated approve to be notified and give permission to the user.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/felixgborrego/gpc-pam-jit/cmd/gcp-jit
```

## Usage:

* List the available entitlements:
```shell
gcp-jit entitlements --project prj-xxx-33333
```
Example output:
```shell
Your current GCP user has the following entitlements for the project prj-xxx-33333 and location global:

üõ°Ô∏è Entitlement: database-access (1h0m0s)
